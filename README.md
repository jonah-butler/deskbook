### Purpose
The rvalibrary deskbook is a CRUD application for handling and storing all procedural info and helpful tidbits relating to the Richmond Public Library. This  also includes procedural documents, reference queries and more. There are two types of accounts: admins and viewers. Admins are able to create, modify and arrange Categories and FAQs while viewers are capable of just that, viewing. Each user is able to create their own private information hub, in addition to browsing the system wide knowledge base created by admins.
